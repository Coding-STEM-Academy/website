Technologies used:  
Vue.js <br /> 
Jenkins/Docker <br />
SASS <br />

When implementing a new feature, use the following commands: <br />
`git checkout -b <name>/<feature-name>`

When you are ready to push your changes to the repository, use the following commands: <br />
`git add -A` <br />
`git commit -m "message"` <br/>
`git push` <br />
<br />

Please merge into the develop branch and see if it works on the deployment pipeline. master branch is sacred as that is the code currently in production.
