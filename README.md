# New Website Project #
<br />

## Rebuilding the Coding STEM Academy tutoring center website! ##
We're planning to use the newest industry technologies to redesign and revamp the website for the tutoring center! 
<br />

## Technologies used: ##
Vue.js <br /> 
Jenkins/Docker <br />
SASS <br />
Gulp <br />
<br />

## Development ##
When implementing a new feature, use the following commands: <br />
`git checkout -b <name>/<feature-name>`

When you are ready to push your changes to the repository, use the following commands: <br />
`git add -A` <br />
`git commit -m "message"` <br/>
`git push` <br />
<br />

Please merge into the develop branch and see if it works on the deployment pipeline. master branch is sacred as that is the code currently in production.
